The dataset includes 2100 images.
Insects-cells-6fXJ-bees-Eson are annotated in YOLOv5 Oriented Object Detection format.

The following pre-processing was applied to each image:
* Auto-orientation of pixel data (with EXIF-orientation stripping)
* Resize to 640x640 (Stretch)
* Auto-contrast via contrast stretching

The following augmentation was applied to create 3 versions of each source image:
* 50% probability of horizontal flip
* 50% probability of vertical flip
* Equal probability of one of the following 90-degree rotations: none, clockwise, counter-clockwise, upside-down
* Random shear of between -5° to +5° horizontally and -6° to +6° vertically
* Random brigthness adjustment of between -10 and +10 percent
